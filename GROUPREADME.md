ANALYSIS OF INCOMES AND LOANS OF INDIVIDUALS ALONG WITH THEIR AGES

This Notebook is a comprehensive data analysis of a bank loan dataset. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, education level, years of employment, address, income, debt-to-income ratio, credit debt, other debt, and a default indicator. The primary goal of the Notebook is to understand the characteristics of the individuals who default on their loans and identify any patterns or correlations that might exist within the data.

The Notebook begins by installing the necessary Python libraries for the analysis, including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for basic plotting, and seaborn for more advanced statistical visualizations. It then reads the data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure that allows for flexible data manipulation.

Next, the Notebook performs data cleaning to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis. This includes removing duplicate rows and rows with missing values, changing the data types of some columns for appropriate analysis, and recoding the 'default' column to binary values to simplify the interpretation of results.

The Notebook then describes the data by providing descriptive statistics for the 'age,' 'income,' and 'default' columns. It calculates the mean and median 'age' and 'income' for each 'default' group, providing a clear picture of these variables' central tendency and dispersion. It also calculates the correlation between 'default' and 'income,' indicating the linear relationship between these two variables.

KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED
Who is most likely to get approved for a loan?
How does income effect ability to repay a loan?
What age is most likely to default?
